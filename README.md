### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ashwin, currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science at University of Southern California, where I am honing my skills in Python, Machine Learning and Data Science. This GitHub repository serves as a canvas where I paint my coding journey, showcasing projects and snippets that reflect my love for innovation and problem solving.

Feel free to browse through my work, and if something catches your eye or sparks a conversation, I'd love to hear from you!
